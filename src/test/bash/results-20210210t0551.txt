FAILURE. Test: wire-10. Expected result to contain this: [It's a bunny? Blue and white, and fluffy... but big! And heavy!]. Instead found: [Right. Let’s take a break. Securing the premises is tiring! You set the lantern down on the desk. That causes a small round shadow to appear. A shadow? You recognize it is cast by a button. What would that do? Want to find out, Wire 10? Press y for yes. Or be boring and press n for no.
Out of the middle of the desk, a screen flips up. It has a USB port on the side. But you have nothing to plug into it. Doesn’t it feel like you might be missing out on something important, Wire 10? Press y if so. If not, press n.
The locker contains cleaning supplies and 2 sets of clothes: a spare security guard uniform, and a cleaner’s outfit. Wouldn’t you like to inspect the cleaning supplies? If yes, press y. But you know that curiosity kills the cat. So maybe not? If not, press n.
No need to get your hands dirty, right Wire 10? After all you aren’t the cleaner. And the bucket won’t be stealing no ice cream. Alright. Let’s cool off with some cold water from the fountain. Press w. Or press d to take a break and sit down at the desk. Feel like quitting? Press q!
Suddenly you hear glass sliding on glass. The mirror mounted on the wall above the fountain slides away. The space behind it is dark. Something in there is making its way out into the light! Where you are, Wire 10! Jump out of the way, quick! Press a!
Oh dear! It fell out, bumped on the fountain, and landed right on top of you! It’s a bunny? Blue and white, and fluffy… but big! And heavy! So heavy! It studies you. With square eyes. Does it seem confused? Hard to tell. It sniffs at your face. You struggle to push it off. Can’t… move! Can’t… breathe! Is that singing you hear? Crying? Can’t tell. Can’t… (Game over. Press q.)
Come back to play another day, Wire 10? Bring your friends! Bye!

FAILURE. Test: wire-12. Expected result to contain this: [You're in the hallway. Alone. You hear children's music. Where is it coming from?]. Instead found: [You found a memory stick! What would be stored on it? Must be important! Looks like you’ll need a USB port to plug that in. There is nothing else here. Press s to study your finds at the desk.
You set your lantern down on the table. Next to it, you place the map and the memory stick. You keep the shield on your arm. Might come in handy. Now where can you plug in the memory stick? It looks like you need a USB port. On the desk you spot the round shadow of a button. Maybe that gives access to a USB port? To press the button, press y. To ignore it and resume guarding duty until the morning, press n.
The door bell rings. Would that be thieves? You walk to the ice cream parlor. The hallway lights turn on and you get met by a familiar face. It’s your employer, Jacques Masquie. What’s he doing here at this hour? He says: “Hey there, Wire 12! How’s it going? Shift’s over for today. See you tomorrow night! Same ice cream time, same ice cream channel!” He laughs. Like he made a joke. Probably a quaint reference to some old book or TV show. Anyway: press w to continue into night 3!
Welcome back, Wire 12. This is night 3. Good to have you here. Jacques Masquie, your employer, promised today would be busy. He left you a letter. Maybe that will tell you what to expect? To read it, press h. There’s enough moonlight to read by. You don’t have to read it. Go ahead and ignore it! You know you want to! Press w.
The letter reads: “How’s it going, Wire 12? Ready for this? The customers got a special treat today: an obstacle course! Unfortunately we kind-of lost track of some. We don’t know whether they’re still in there. It is your job tonight to inspect the obstacle course and flush out any stragglers. That’s going to be easy if you have a map. And you won’t have to worry about any animatronics: they’ve been stored for the night. I’ll be back tomorrow morning to debrief you! Signed, Jacques Masquie.” Quit while you can! Press q. Or keep playing: press w.
You’re in the hallway. Alone. You hear children’s music. Where is it coming from? You haven’t seen a radio anywhere, yet. Anyway, better strap up that shield. Also pull up that map: it should help guide you and avoid the animatronics. To turn left, press a. To go forward, press w. Or press d to turn right.
Come back to play another day, Wire 12? Bring your friends! Bye!

FAILURE. Test: wire-13. Expected result to contain this: [So how do you know where to go? Just... pick a direction?]. Instead found: [Really now? That’s a bit dramatic, isn’t it, Wire 13? The video continues: something jumped the security guard and they fell out of view. He’s screaming. Is that the sound of wet rags dropping on the floor? Oh dear, blood spatters? You look around the room: no blood anywhere, now. The video stopped. Was it a prank? It must have been a prank! Press y if so. If not, press n.
The door bell rings. Would that be thieves? You walk to the ice cream parlor. The hallway lights turn on and you get met by a familiar face. It’s your employer, Jacques Masquie. What’s he doing here at this hour? He says: “Hey there, Wire 13! How’s it going? Shift’s over for today. Anything problematic to report?” Hmm… You saw that video, didn’t you? Do you feel like telling Masquie? If yes, press y. Or press n to stay silent and pretend you didn’t see nothing, and jump straight into night 3!

Erm. What? Smoke is blocking your view. It’s dissapating slowly. This is not at all where you expected to go. Did you take a wrong turn? Did you get teleported? Your stomach certainly feels like it. You look around. This looks like the start of the obstacle course. Oh no. You have nothing to protect yourself and no map to tell you where to go. This is not going to be fun. Press q to quit now! Or, if you’re brave, press a direction (a, w, d, or s). Right now is your chance to get some help though. Want it? Press h.
You arrived at a cliff. You can’t see the bottom. Better not fall in. Even though this is an ice cream parlor. There’s 3 platforms that you could reach… by jumping. To your left, forward, and right. They’re too far away from each other. And too dark to see anything there unless you’re on them. So how do you know where to go? Just… pick a direction? To jump left, press a. Press w to jump forward. Or d for right.

FAILURE. Test: wire-2. Expected result to contain this: [Making Maskie's Ice Cream very popular.]. Instead found: [You are in a lit office. By the right wall there is a desk with a lantern, a water fountain by the far wall, and a locker to the left. Your employer gave you a letter. To read it, press h. You don’t have to read it. You could ignore it and instead press w to drink water from the fountain. Or press d to study the desk. To inspect the locker, press a. To go back to the hallway, press s.
The letter reads: “Dear Wire 2, 
Welcome to Maskie’s Ice Cream! Great to have you on staff. Due a pandemic killing lots of people, I replaced all human employees with animatronics. Lots of them! They’re like robots, but better. And they look like stuffed animals for kids. That means no people touch the ice cream, thus no viruses get transmitted. Making Maskie’s Ice Cream very popular. So popular that thieves like to come and steal the ice cream. That’s where you come in, Wire 2. Your job is to keep out the thieves. See you tomorrow! 
Sincerely, 
Jacques Masquie, owner.” 
Press w to continue.

Press w to keep playing. Want to quit? Press q.
Hello, Wire 3. You’re a security guard. You got hired to keep this place secure. The hallway is dark: it is night. Security lights show the way to the exit, and light up just enough of the hallway to see it’s absurdly clean, and to spot the walls and doors. You hear some children’s music playing. From where? Speakers in the ceiling? And why? It’s night time! They should turn that off. Where do you want to go next? To go forward: press w. Press a to turn left. There’s a light there. To turn right, press d.
You are in a lit office. By the right wall there is a desk with a lantern, a water fountain by the far wall, and a locker to the left. Your employer gave you a letter. To read it, press h.

The locker is really dark. You can’t see anything. Wouldn’t you feel better with a lantern? Didn’t you see one on the desk? To check the desk, press d. To rummage around the locker anyway, press w. To give up and quit, press q.
Ack! Something just grabbed you! You can’t see what it is: it’s too dark! It jumps on you. You fall over backwards, cracking your head on the edge of the desk. The desk with the lantern. The light makes your attacker visible. It’s… an animatronic!? A penguin? Why is it singing? Penguins can’t sing the ice cream song! Can they? Its beak shreds your clothes and your skin. You have nothing to protect yourself. Your blood shorts out the penguin. You faint. You die. Good try, Wire 3. Don’t give up now. Press a to reincarnate and try again. Press q to give up and quit.

FAILURE. Test: wire-5. Expected result to contain this: [That's going to make a mess!]. Instead found: [You take his lantern… but also his arm. Blood sprays from his torso onto the ice cream painting. He screams. It hurts your ears. You want to silence him. But his head is so very fragile. It breaks and falls off. The guard’s body sags to the tiled floor. You step backwards to avoid the spreading blood. Walking through the hallway, you see a mirror above the fountain. Let’s make sure no blood hit you. And if so, clean up. You see your face. You look kind-of like that guard. Not quite. Your eyes and ears are square, and your mouth has no lips to cover your teeth. Metal teeth. And so many! Confused you drop the lantern and disappear into a dark room. 

Press w to keep playing. Want to quit? Press q.
Hello, Wire 5. You’re a security guard. You got hired to keep this place secure. The hallway is dark: it is night.

To turn right, press d.
You are in the ice cream parlor. It is closed for the night. The lights are off. You can make out tables and cabinets in the light of the moon. And what’s that? In the shadows behind the counter? Is that a person? Could be a thief! To do your duty and inspect the situation, press w. However, you might be a coward. Are you a coward, Wire 5? If so, press s to go back to the hallway. It won’t be any better, though. Now choose.
You get attacked! You can’t see them: it’s too dark! Wasn’t there a lantern in the office? You really could’ve used that now. The attacker grabs you by the neck, and pulls you really close to their face. ITs face. It’s an animatronic. With no lips on a mouth filled with sharp metal teeth. Cameras instead of eyes. With an ice cream cone for 1 ear, and some wires where the other should have been. With bulbous arms that grab you and instead of a hand, an ice scoop that scoops out your eyes. It rips out your brain and eats it. That’s going to make a mess! Now choose: to reincarnate and try again, press a. To give up and quit, press q.

FAILURE. Test: wire-8. Expected result to contain this: [If only you had had something to protect yourself! But you don't.]. Instead found: [The desk holds a lantern. It’s the only light in the room. You probably should pick it up and carry it around as you roam the premises. You know: so you don’t stumble over anything in the dark. To pick up the lantern, press y. Otherwise, press n.
Lantern in hand, you now see a letter on the desk, with your name on it. Would you like to read it, Wire 8? If yes, press y. If not, press n.

Aah, fresh, clean water! You needed that. The heat is getting unbearable! There’s a mirror on the wall in front of you. Let’s check your hair. Got to look the part, after all. To lean forward and look into the mirror, press w. To return to the office, press s.
You see yourself, Wire 8. The light from the lantern does you no favors. You straighten your hair. And spot something shoot by from the corner of your eye. What do you do? Chase it? Press w. Stay in the room and keep looking for other things that may help? Press s.
Oh how courageous! You ran after whatever it was, into the hallway. You can see it clearly now: it’s a pink animatronic cat! And it’s coming for you really fast! If only you had had something to protect yourself! But you don’t. Didn’t you see the shield in the office locker? Didn’t you take it? Why not? Too late now! The cat runs you over. It’s heavy. Way heavier than a real cat. Your bones crush and break as the cat claws into your body. Your scream is drowned out by the music. So loud! Then you faint. And die. Where does the cat go? Why did it attack you? No clue… yet. Want to find out? Press a to reincarnate and try again. Or run away and quit, by pressing q.
