# This script assumes the following:
# 1. It lives in a child folder underneath
#    the one in which the game Maskies lives.
# 2. It has sibling files named "wire-1.txt"
#    and "name-1.txt" etc.
# 3. It has a sibling program named 
#    MaskiesWireTest that checks the output
#    generated by Maskies based on a wire.
# 4. MaskiesWireTest knows each wire by name
#    and the output each expects.
