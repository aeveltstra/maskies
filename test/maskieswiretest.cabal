name:                MaskiesWireTest
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Testing walk-throughs through Maskies, the text-based horror adventure game.
description:         Maskies offers several timelines and solutions. It gets too much to remember each. Thus, walk-through wires got created. The test application compares the output of each against expectations and reports success or failure.
